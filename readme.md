# AI-based Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization Tool

## Overview

The AI-based Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization Tool is an interactive Python application designed to visualize and understand various pathfinding algorithms. This project enables users to explore how algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS etc., work by visualizing their execution on customizable grids in real-time. The tool also provides an intuitive user interface for creating and editing mazes, making it an excellent educational and experimental platform.

## TODO
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Real-time visualization of A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS pathfinding algorithms.
- **Customizable Grids**: Create and modify grids with obstacles, start, and end nodes.
- **Interactive UI**: Design mazes, set start and end points, and select algorithms via an intuitive interface.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Watch algorithms explore paths and find solutions dynamically.
- **Python-Based**: Built using Python and Pygame for cross-platform compatibility.


## Technologies Using

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the algorithms.
- **Pygame**: Library used for grid visualization and UI development.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Ensures efficient and smooth execution of pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms going to Implement

1. **A***:
   - Optimized pathfinding algorithm using heuristics to prioritize exploration.
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Guarantees the shortest path by exploring all possible routes systematically.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Explores all nodes layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path for unweighted grids.
4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Explores paths deeply before backtracking, not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
